RemoveRecords : Dt : 21/5/2020
  Relevant files:
      a. /RemoveRecords/RemoveTeacher.php
  CHECK:
    No user records should be ever removed from the database. Check if the query removes the record or flags visibility as 0

Deployment of activity:
  Relevant files:
    a. /Activity/addnewtest.php
      i. process starts with Deploy button > deploy() on same page to prepare ajax call ajaxDeployActivity()
    b. /Scripts/js/ajaxCallActivities.js > Creates ajax calls sends to the deploytest.php
    c. /Activity/deploytest.php > saves deployment.
    Problem: deployment Id is autoincrement. The deploytest.php is saving the record twice in the deploymentlog table. Solution:
    Step 1: So created a constraint Dedupe that (assessmentId	+ depType	+ schStartDate) have to be unique. Now it saves only once. However, auto increment jumps a number next time something is saved. This means the sql has used up the missing auto increment but not saved the record.
    Step 2: How to remove this glitch?
