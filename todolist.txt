Deployment of activity:
  Relevant files:
    a. /Activity/addnewtest.php
      i. process starts with Deploy button > deploy() on same page to prepare ajax call ajaxDeployActivity()
    b. /Scripts/js/ajaxCallActivities.js > Creates ajax calls sends to the deploytest.php
    c. /Activity/deploytest.php > saves deployment.
Problem: deployment Id is autoincrement. The deploytest.php is saving the record twice in the deploymentlog table. Solution:
  Step 1: So created a constraint Dedupe that (assessmentId	+ depType	+ schStartDate) have to be unique. Now it saves only once. However, auto increment jumps a number next time something is saved. This means the sql has used up the missing auto increment but not saved the record.
  Step 2: How to remove this glitch?

Teachers: 8 May 2020
  Relevant files:
  a. /SetUpPages/newTeachers.php
    i. function modalclick(this) calls the following
    ii. ajaxCallTeachers(e.id,e.innerText) which exists in
  b. /Scripts/js/ajaxCallTeachers.js
    i. ajaxCallTeachers(t,p) sends ajax request to
  c. /Scripts/php/singleTeacherClasses.php?teacherId=" with teacher Id which pulls all the classes, sections, and subjects taught by the teacher. Explore button triggers
    i. function exploreclick(b) calls the following
    ii. ajaxCallExploreItem(b.id) which exists in
  d. /Scripts/js/ajaxCallTeachers.js sends a request to
  e. /Scripts/php/exploreTeacher.php? with teacher id, class id, and section id
  Problem: Is it over kill? The Explore button only wants to show the students in the relevant class. Why send teacher Id with it?

Classes: 9 May 2020
  Relevant files:
  a. /SetUpPages/newclasses_taught_by_teachers.php
Problem: The existing classes display is displaying the some records multiple times and others only once. SOLVED
Problem: Need to be able to display a Teacher Name and then below that, all the classes-sections-subjects. Currently, each record for each teacher is a separate line.
